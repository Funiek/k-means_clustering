# k-means_clustering
## Simple C++ implementation of k-means clustering algorithm
<p>Primitive version of k-means algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)</p>

<p>in.txt is an example of input file, storing coordinates of points line by line;</p>
<p>Format of input in program: "<code><algorithms iterations> <amount of clusters> <path to file></code>";</p>
<p>Program is made in a really simple way so it has no exception handling, input check etc.</p>
